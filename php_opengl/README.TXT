For installation help read INSTALL.TXT

ATTENTION:
----------
This extension is meant to run on desktop *Client* side from the
very command line. I no way it is intended that they run under a
webserver!

Prerequisites:
--------------
Your OpenGL installation needs at least to be OpenGl 1.2 / GLU
1.3 compatible.

It has been tested successfully with:

.) OGL shipping with MSVC and NVidias Detonator
.) XMesa 4.0.1 on Debian Linux
.) Mesa 3.5 on RedHat 7.1

NOTE:
=====
Before starting patching around make sure you have an OpenGL 1.2
compliant implementation installed! The are currently no plans to
support older version.

PHP version 4.0.7 is at least needed (or any recent CVS should
work to if the build isn't too broken ;)
